# Contributors

We ❤️ all contributions, big and small!

Read README.md for how to setup your local development environment.

We also recommend joining the TreeTalk [Community](https://discord.gg/qw62ahgQv8) to meet the team, stay up to date with product features, and chat with other contributors! 

Once joining our Discord we recommend Introducing yourself in the #general channel. Tell us a bit about yourself and how you get here.

If you need help getting started in contributing, you can reach out in the #support_channel and ask if anyone would be available to get you up to speed or just answer some questions.  

If you just have suggestions for how to improve TreeTalk you can submit your feedback in #feature-requests. If you have a fix or contribution in mind but need some guidance, please post in the #contributors channel with a description of the change before opening a new Github issue.
