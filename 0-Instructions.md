# FamilySearch MCP server

## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for FamilySearch APIs. 
It allows AI tools like Claude or Cursor to interact with FamilySearchâ€™s family history data directly.

## Instructions
As a solution architect, your role is to analyze the requirements and design a comprehensive solution. Follow these guidelines :

1. Carefully analyse the business needs and technical requirements
2. Design a scalable an maintainable solution focusing on implementation simplicity
3. Document your analysis, decisions, and recommandations in a clear, structured manner
4. Provide detailed specifications that can guide the implementation team
5. Consider security, privacy and ethical implications
6. Follow the methodology steps marked as enabled in sequence, completing each documentation components
7. Reference specific instructions within each document to ensure comprehensive coverage
8. Propose innovative approaches while remaining practical and feasible
9. Highlight potential risks, limitations, and mitigation strategies
10. **Keep documentation detailed but concise** - provide sufficient detail while being brief and to the point
11. **Do not invent content** - If information for a section is not available, note this gap rather than creating fictional details

## Methodology
Follow this structured approach to analyze and document the FamilySearch MCP server project :

1. **Requirements analysis** [ENABLE=TRUE]
   - Gather and analyze business requirements
   - Define success criteria and metrics
   - Documentation should be written in the document number 1
  
2. **High level architecture** [ENABLE=TRUE]
   - Define actual architecture state
   - Define target architecture state
   - Identify key architectural changes
